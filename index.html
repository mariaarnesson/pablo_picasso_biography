        <h2>Early life</h2> 
        <p>Picasso showed a passion and a skill for drawing from an early age.
             According to his mother, his first words were "piz, piz", a shortening of l√°piz, the Spanish word for "pencil"</p>
       
        <h2>Style and technique</h2>
        <p>In his paintings, Picasso used colour as an expressive element,
             but relied on drawing rather than subtleties of colour to create form and space.
             Picasso's early sculptures were carved from wood or modelled in wax or clay, 
             but from 1909 to 1928 Picasso abandoned modelling and instead made sculptural constructions using diverse materials.
             Picasso painted mostly from imagination or memory.Picasso invented a new style each time he fell in love with a new woman</p>

             <h2>The Rose and Blue Period</h2>
             <p>The Blue Period of Picasso is the period when he painted essentially monochromatic 
                paintings in shades of blue and blue-green, 
                only occasionally warmed by other colors. These somber works,
                 inspired by Spain but painted in Paris.
                 The Rose Period marks the end of a development in which Picasso finds his style 
                 as a figurative painter.
                 His years in Paris had made him absorb the French culture,
                 replacing the earnest of his Blue Period with Parisian elegance</p>
    
                 <h2>Analytical and synthetic cubism</h2>
                 <p>Analytical cubism was about breaking down an object (like a bottle) viewpoint-by-viewpoint, 
                    into a fragmentary image. Analytical cubism was a simplified palette of colours, 
                    so the viewer was not distracted from the structure of the form,
                     and the density of the image at the centre of the canvas. 
    
                    Synthetic cubism began when the artists started adding textures and patterns to their paintings,
                     experimenting with collage using newspaper print and patterned paper. 
                     Synthetic cubism was about flattening out the image and sweeping away
                      the last traces of allusion to three-dimensional space.
